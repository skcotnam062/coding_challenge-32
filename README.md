# Coding Challenge 32 - Keiko Corp Startup

Build your own version of the Keiko Corp Website *(With a bonus of Pair Programming!)*

Last month, for Hacktoberfest, [we completed a group project for the Keiko Corp startup](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Keiko-Corp). We finished the month with a Responsive Layouts workshop on https://zerotomastery.io/academy recreating the Keiko Corp mockup. Now, we want you to show us your CSS skills. Take the [Figma Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/NY0Do1PFf4xl0ZuSTA1X9U/Keiko-Corp-Hacktoberfest-Project?node-id=2%3A8) and show us your version of a mobile-first, responsive website. Try to use modern CSS, Flexbox and Grid, and relative units to create a fluid website for the Keiko Corp startup.

## BUT WAIT! - THERE IS MORE

This month we are using an awesome new tool called GitDuck to make live pair programming possible! How does this work? Keep in mind this is optional if you want to work with someone, but we do recommend doing this:

1. Find a partner to do the coding challenge with in the **#coding-challenge** channel on our Discord server.
2. Both of you will need to visit https://gitduck.com/ and install the extension *(we recommend using VS Code for the best experience)*
3. Start live pair programming and working on the coding challenge together! 

## The Rules Are:

1. Use the mobile-first technique and modern CSS (Flexbox and Grid).

2. Do not copy someone elses code. Try to start from scratch and use the Figma file to come up with your own version of the website. If you struggle with creating the HTML, you can use the **start** branch of the [workshop repo](https://github.com/brittneypostma/workshop-keiko-corp).

3. **You have until November 30th at 11:59pm EST** to submit your site (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the **#coding-challenge** Discord group with the following message:  *-challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY"* . The bot will listen for the command and will reply with "thanks for your submission" if it succeeded.

4. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and create something unique. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team.

## One Last Thing!

**Please note: As with all of our challenges, there is zero benefit or monetary gain we receive from it. This is just our way of extending the classroom and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of the courses.**
